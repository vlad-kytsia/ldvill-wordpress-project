## 📝 Project Description
This project was completed in **October 2024**.  
I converted the provided Figma design into a pixel-perfect HTML/CSS/JavaScript template and then integrated it into WordPress by creating a custom theme.

To implement dynamic content, I used **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**.  
The website also includes a multilingual setup using **Polylang**, a contact form created with **Contact Form 7**, and security/backup configuration using **Better WP Security** and **UpdraftPlus**.
